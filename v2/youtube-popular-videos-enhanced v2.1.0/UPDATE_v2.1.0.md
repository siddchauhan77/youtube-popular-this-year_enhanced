# 🔧 v2.1.0 - Auto-Reset Fix for YouTube Native Filters

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **The Problem:**
When you clicked YouTube's native "Popular" or "Oldest" button, then clicked one of our time period filters, the results were incomplete because:
1. YouTube's "Popular" button fetched only popular videos (incomplete dataset)
2. Our filter then filtered that already-filtered list
3. Result: Missing videos that should have appeared!

### **The Solution:**
Our extension now **automatically resets YouTube's native filters** before applying our time period filters.

**How it works:**
```
User clicks "Last Year" button
    ↓
Extension checks: Is "Popular" or "Oldest" active?
    ↓ YES
Extension automatically clicks "Latest"
    ↓
Waits 1.2 seconds for YouTube to reload
    ↓
Applies our "Last Year" filter to COMPLETE dataset
    ↓
Shows accurate results! ✅
```

## 🎯 What Changed in Code

### **File: content-script.js**

#### **1. Enhanced resetYouTubeNativeFilters() - Lines 219-256**

**Before:**
- Basic detection of active filters
- Simple click on "Latest"

**After:**
- ✅ Better attribute checking (`aria-selected` support)
- ✅ Tracks which filter was active (for logging)
- ✅ Clearer console messages with emojis
- ✅ More robust selection detection

```javascript
// New: Better detection
const isSelected = chip.hasAttribute('selected') || 
                   chip.hasAttribute('aria-selected') || 
                   chip.getAttribute('aria-selected') === 'true';

// New: Track active filter
if ((text === 'Popular' || text === 'Oldest') && isSelected) {
  console.log('YouTube Popular This Year: ⚠️  Found active YouTube filter:', text);
  needsReset = true;
  activeFilter = text; // ← New: remember which filter
}
```

#### **2. Increased Wait Time - Line 213**

**Before:**
```javascript
const delay = needsReset ? 800 : 100;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const delay = needsReset ? 1200 : 100; // ← Increased from 800ms to 1200ms
```

**Why:** Some channels take longer to reload. 1.2 seconds ensures YouTube has fully loaded before we filter.

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Test Scenario 1: Popular + Time Filter**

1. Go to: https://www.youtube.com/@MrBeast/videos
2. Click YouTube's **"Popular"** button (should turn black/selected)
3. Click our **"Last 3 Months"** button
4. **Watch the magic:**
   - Extension automatically clicks "Latest"
   - Wait ~1 second
   - Videos reload
   - Then filter to last 3 months
5. **Verify:** You should see ALL videos from last 3 months (not just popular ones)

### **Test Scenario 2: Oldest + Time Filter**

1. Go to any channel
2. Click YouTube's **"Oldest"** button
3. Click our **"Last 7 Days"** button
4. **Expected:** Auto-reset to Latest, then filter to 7 days

### **Test Scenario 3: Already on Latest**

1. Make sure YouTube's "Latest" is active (or click it)
2. Click our **"Last Year"** button
3. **Expected:** Immediate filtering (no reset needed, no delay)

### **Test Scenario 4: Console Logging**

Open DevTools Console (F12) and watch the messages:

**When reset is needed:**
```
YouTube Popular This Year: Time period selected: 3months
YouTube Popular This Year: ⚠️  Found active YouTube filter: Popular
YouTube Popular This Year: 🔄 Resetting from "Popular" to "Latest" to get complete dataset...

YouTube Popular This Year: Waiting 1200ms before applying filter...
YouTube Popular This Year: Capturing current video data...
YouTube Popular This Year: Found 45 videos to filter
YouTube Popular This Year: Filtered 28 videos from 45 total
```

**When no reset needed:**
```
YouTube Popular This Year: Time period selected: 1year
YouTube Popular This Year: ✅ No YouTube filter active, using current dataset
YouTube Popular This Year: Waiting 100ms before applying filter...
YouTube Popular This Year: Capturing current video data...
YouTube Popular This Year: Found 45 videos to filter

```

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### **Symptoms:**

1. **Videos don't filter after clicking time button**
   - Check console for errors
   - Verify YouTube reloaded (look for page flash)
   - Try clicking "Latest" manually first

2. **Takes too long to filter**
   - Normal! 1.2 second delay is intentional
   - Ensures YouTube fully reloads before filtering
   - Only happens when YouTube filter was active

3. **Still shows incomplete results**
   - Check which button is active on YouTube
   - Verify our extension clicked "Latest" (check console)
   - Try refreshing the page and starting fresh

### **Quick Fix:**
If issues persist, click YouTube's "Latest" button manually before using our filters.
